Rejects if not, or if it encounters an error

GooglePay.requestPayment(totalPrice, currency)

totalPrice must be a string representation of the total price - e.g. for Â£10.78, it would be 10.78
currency must be a valid ISO 4217 currency code for the transaction
Resolves when the journey is complete, with the stripe token
Rejects if an error occurs
